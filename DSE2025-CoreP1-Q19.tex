The equation of the straight line $L$ is $4x-3y+83=0$. The equation of the circle $C$ is $x^2+y^2+ax-2y+b=0$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive constants. It is given that $C$ passes through the point $(-10,9)$ and $L$ is a tangent to $C$.
\begin{enumx}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove that the equation $25x^2+(9a+640)x+(90a+4924)=0$ has equal roots. Hence, find $a$ and $b$.
	\marks{4}
    \item The coordinates of the point $P$ are $(-20,1)$. Let $Q$ be a point lying below $L$ such that $PQ$ is tangent to $C$ and $PQ=25$. Denote the centre of $C$ by $I$.
    \begin{enumx}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Find $\cos\angle IPQ$.
        \item Find, in surd form, the distance between $I$ and $Q$.
        \item Let $R$ be a point lying on $L$ such that $C$ is the inscribed circle of $\triangle PQR$. Denote the radius of the circumcircle of $\triangle PQR$ by $r$. Someone claims that $r>PQ$. Is the claim correct? Explain your answer.
