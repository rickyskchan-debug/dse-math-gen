Let $g(x) = 3x^2 - 6kx + 24x + 3k^2 - 24k + 55$, where $k$ is a positive constant. Denote the vertex of the graph of $y=g(x)$ by $R$.


\begin{enumx}[label=(\alph*)]
   \item Using the method of completing the square, express the coordinates of $R$ in terms of $k$.
	\marks{2}
    \item The graph of $y=h(x)$ is obtained by translating the graph of $y=g(x)$ rightwards by 6 units and then downwards by 10 units. Denote the vertex of the graph of $y=h(x)$ by $S$. Let $T$ be a point such that the orthocentre of $\triangle RST$ is the origin.
    \begin{enumx}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Express the coordinates of $T$ in terms of $k$.
        \item The coordinates of the point $U$ are $(-5,5)$. Let $V$ be a point lying on $RS$ such that $TV$ is perpendicular to $RS$. It is given that $S$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ are concyclic. Find $k$.
