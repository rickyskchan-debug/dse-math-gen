It is given that $a, b, c$ and $d$ are four distinct real numbers. Let $m_1$ and $r_1$ be the mean, the range and the variance of the group of numbers $\{a, b, c, d\}$ respectively while $m_2$, $r_2$ and $v_2$ be the mean, the range and the variance of the group of numbers $\{2a, 2b, 2c, 2d\}$ respectively. Denote the mean, the range and the variance of the group of numbers $\{a+3, b+3, c+3, d+3\}$ by $m_3, r_3$ and $v_3$ respectively. Which of the following are true?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[I.] $m_1+m_3>m_2$
        \item[II.] $r_1+r_3=r_2$
        \item[III.] $v_1+v_3<v_2$
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[A.] I and II only
        \item[B.] I and III only
        \item[C.] II and III only
        \item[D.] I, II and III
    \end{itemize}
