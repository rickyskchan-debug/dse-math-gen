The coordinates of the point $A$ are $(4,-2)$. $A$ is rotated clockwise about the origin $O$ through $90^{\circ}$ to $B$.

\begin{enumx}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Write down the coordinates of $B$.
\item Suppose that $B$ is translated upwards by $t$ units to the point $C$. If $A$, $O$ and $C$ are collinear, find $t$.
