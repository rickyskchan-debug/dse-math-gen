The stem-and-leaf diagram below shows the distribution of the weights (in kg) of some athletes before training.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
    Stem (tens) & Leaf (units) \\
    \hline
    4 & 5 \quad 6 \quad 8 \\
    5 & $w$ \quad $w$ \quad 6 \quad 7 \\
    6 & 3 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 6 \quad 9 \quad 9 \\
    7 & 0 \quad 2 \\
    8 & 7 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The difference of the range and the inter-quartile range of the above distribution is 25 kg.

\begin{enumx}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item Write down the range of the above distribution. Hence, find $w$.

    \item The box-and-whisker diagram below shows the distribution of the weights (in kg) of the athletes after the training.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{placeholder_image} % This is a placeholder, you would need to provide the actual image
    \end{center}

    \begin{enumx}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Find the change in the upper quartile of the distribution due to the training.
        \item Is the distribution of the weights of the athletes after the training less dispersed than that before the training? Explain your answer.
